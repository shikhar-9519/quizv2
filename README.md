# quizv2
there are two modules - 
quiz-app (Frontend)
my-mock-api (Backend)

for quiz-app module, we need to install dependencies via npm install.
for my-mock-api module, we need to install express via npm install express.

quiz-app is built using react. we can run it via npm start. 

my-mock-api is backend built using nodeJS, and expressJS. we can run it via node server.js

When we will start the app, the home page will render having a start button. on Clicking the start button, questions will start coming one after the other.
On clicking submit button, the selected option as well as the time taken to answer the question is stored in the backend and new question data will be sent as response.
After answering the questions, the result page will render showing the number of correct and incorrect answers. There will be a start again button to again start the quiz.

In Short - 

to run frontend -> npm install(only first time) => npm start

to run backend -> npm install express(only first time) => node server.js
